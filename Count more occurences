/*
Given an array arr[] of size N and an element k. The task is to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3}
k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and
 2 are the only elements that appears 
more than n/k times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2,3,3,2}
k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 
are the only elements that appears more 
than n/k times. So the count of elements 
are 2.

*/


/*
SOLUTION APPROACH:

create a map and count frequence
if frequence count is greater then x/k then increase the count by one 

return count
