/*
Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant 
array should not contain any negative integers.


Example 1:

Input:
K = 2, N = 4
Arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The array can be modified as 
{3, 3, 6, 8}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
Example 2:

Input:
K = 3, N = 5
Arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
Output:
11
Explanation:
The array can be modified as
{6, 12, 9, 13, 17}. The difference between 
the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11.
