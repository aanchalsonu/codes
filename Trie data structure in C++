This is one of the datastructure used in C++
here we use the convept similar to tree
where Binary tree has only atmost 2 nodes there is no restriction in number of nodes for tries
for ex: For the alphabet range between a-z there can be 26 nodes for root
class called tries is decalred 
which has a node pointer, data and isterminal boolean value

This has time complexity of O(l)
where l is the length of the string

struct TrieNode 
{ 
     struct TrieNode *children[ALPHABET_SIZE];
     // isEndOfWord is true if the node 
     // represents end of a word 
     bool isEndOfWord; 
}; 

we can perform insertion ,deletion and searching on tries
