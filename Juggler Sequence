/*

Juggler Sequence is a series of integers in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation:

Juggler Formula

Given a number N, find the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence.


Example 1:

Input: N = 9
Output: 9 27 140 11 36 6 2 1
Explaination: We start with 9 and use 
above formula to get next terms.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = 6
Output: 6 2 1
Explaination: 
61/2 = 2. 
21/2 = 1.
